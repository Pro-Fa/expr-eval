# Type Improvements Summary

## Overview
Successfully replaced trivial `any` types with more specific types throughout the expr-eval codebase to improve type safety and developer experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Type Definitions (types.ts)
- ✅ Updated `VariableValue.value` from `any` to `Value`
- ✅ Updated `VariableResolveResult` to use `Value` instead of `any`
- ✅ Enhanced `Value` type to support functions that return `Promise<Value>` for async operations

### 2. Expression Class (expression.ts)
- ✅ Updated `evaluate()` return type from `any` to `Value | Promise<Value>`
- ✅ Updated `toJSFunction()` parameters and return type to use `Value` types
- ✅ Added proper import for `Value` type

### 3. Parser Class (parser.ts)
- ✅ Updated `Values` type from `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, Value>`
- ✅ Updated `VariableValue.value` from `any` to `Value`
- ✅ Updated `VariableResolveResult` to use `Value` instead of `any`
- ✅ Updated `consts` property from `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, Value>`
- ✅ Updated `evaluate()` methods to return `Value | Promise<Value>`
- ✅ Updated instruction array type from `any[]` to `Instruction[]`

### 4. Evaluation Engine (evaluate.ts)
- ✅ Updated all type definitions to use `Value` and `Values` types
- ✅ Updated function return types to support `Value | Promise<Value>`
- ✅ Enhanced type guards to properly handle the new `Value` union type
- ✅ Updated `EvaluationValues` to use `Values` type

### 5. Token Stream (token-stream.ts)
- ✅ Updated `consts` property in `ParserLike` interface to use flexible typing

## Types That Remain as `any` (Intentionally)

### Appropriate `any` Usage
- **OperatorFunction parameters**: Functions like `add(a: any, b: any)` need `any` for type flexibility
- **Type guards**: `isPromise(obj: any)` appropriately uses `any` for type checking
- **Mixed evaluation variables**: `n1, n2, n3` variables handle mixed types during stack evaluation
- **Function arguments arrays**: Some contexts require `any[]` for dynamic argument handling
- **Value escaping**: `escapeValue(v: any)` needs to handle any value for string conversion

### Technical Constraints
- Functions in `functions-binary-ops.ts` and `functions-unary-ops.ts` use `any` parameters to handle the complex type coercion logic required by the expression evaluator

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Enhanced Type Safety
- Method return types now properly reflect that expressions can return any `Value` type
- Variable storage and evaluation use proper typing
- Promise support is now properly typed for async operations

### 2. Better Developer Experience
- IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense now provide accurate type information
- Type errors are caught at compile time instead of runtime
- Clear distinction between synchronous and asynchronous evaluation

### 3. API Clarity
- Clear typing shows which operations can be asynchronous
- Better documentation through types of what values expressions can contain
- Proper typing of configuration objects and options

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass (41/41 tests in expression-core-partial)
- ✅ Build process completes successfully with TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Bundle sizes remain within configured limits
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

## Impact
This improvement enhances the overall code quality and maintainability while preserving backward compatibility. The type system now better reflects the actual runtime behavior of the expression evaluator, making it easier for developers to use the library correctly and catch potential issues during development.
